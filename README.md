Hypothesis Testing Tool
This Python script allows you to perform a one-sample z-test for a specified null hypothesis. It calculates the z-statistic and determines whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis based on a given significance level (default is 0.05, corresponding to a 95% confidence level).

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your computer.
Basic understanding of hypothesis testing and z-tests.
How to Use
Run the script in your Python environment.

You will be prompted to provide the following inputs:

mu_null: The specified null hypothesis mean.
n: The sample size.
x: The sample data values. You can enter multiple values separated by spaces.
If the sample size is 1, you can directly provide the x value.
If the sample size is greater than 1, the script will calculate the sample mean and standard deviation.
The script will calculate the z-statistic based on the provided inputs and compare it to a critical value (default 1.96, corresponding to a 95% confidence level). The result will be one of the following:

If the z-statistic is less than the critical value, it will print "accept null hypothesis."
If the z-statistic is greater than or equal to the critical value, it will print "reject null hypothesis."
Example
makefile
Copy code
specify mu_null, n, x (values)
if you want to give multiple values of x, separate them with spaces
if n is 1, you can type the x value directly, and you have to mention the s value too.

mu_null = 30
n = 10
x = 28 29 31 30 32 30 29 31 29 28
s = 2.5

x_bar = 29.8
s = 2.5
z_calculated = -2.109502310972899
reject null hypothesis
